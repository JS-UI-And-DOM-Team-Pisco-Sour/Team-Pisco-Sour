Relative file paths:
    Starting with "/" returns to the root directory and starts there
    Starting with "../" moves one directory backwards and starts there
    Starting with "../../" moves two directories backwards and starts there (and so on...)
    To move forward, just start with the first subdirectory and keep moving forward
